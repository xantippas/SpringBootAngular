                The pontiff held a mass in the shrine town Saturday to canonize the Marto siblings, making them the youngest saints who did not die as martyrs in the history of the Catholic Church.

                Hundreds of thousands of pilgrims attended the celebrations as church groups, families and individuals flocked to Fatima, 90 miles north of Lisbon.

                Dos Santos, who was nine when she experienced the visions, grew up to become a Carmelite nun and lived until the age of 95.

                She later revealed the prophecies in a memoir and a letter to the Vatican. She is currently on track for beatification, the first step towards becoming a saint. However, the process could not begin until after her death."
