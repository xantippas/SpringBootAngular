    "body":"Francisco and Jacinta Marto — ages 9 and 7, respectively, at the time of the apparitions — died two years later of influenza, leaving their cousin Lucia dos Santos to share the secret messages with the world.
                The pontiff held a mass in the shrine town Saturday to canonize the Marto siblings, making them the youngest saints who did not die as martyrs in the history of the Catholic Church.
                She later revealed the prophecies in a memoir and a letter to the Vatican. She is currently on track for beatification, the first step towards becoming a saint. However, the process could not begin until after her death."
